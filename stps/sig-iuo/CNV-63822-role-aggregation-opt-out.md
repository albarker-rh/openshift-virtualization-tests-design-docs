## **Role Aggregation Opt-Out - Quality Engineering Plan**

### **Metadata & Tracking**

- **Enhancement(s):** [Kubevirt VEP](https://github.com/kubevirt/enhancements/issues/160)
- **Feature Tracking:** [CNV-50792](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-50792)
- **Epic Tracking:** [CNV-63822](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-63822)
- **QE Owner(s):** Ramon Lobillo (@rlobillo), Alex Barker (@albarker-rh)
- **Owning SIG:** sig-iuo (Install, Upgrade, Operators)
- **Participating SIGs:** sig-ui

**Document Conventions (if applicable):** N/A — no feature-specific terms required.

### **Feature Overview**

By default, all project administrators, editors, and viewers automatically receive access to
OpenShift Virtualization resources. Role Aggregation Opt-Out allows cluster administrators to
disable this automatic access and instead grant virtualization permissions explicitly per user
and namespace, enabling fine-grained control in multi-tenant environments.

### **I. Motivation and Requirements Review (QE Review Guidelines)**

This section documents the mandatory QE review process. The goal is to understand the feature's value,
technology, and testability before formal test planning.

#### **1. Requirement & User Story Review Checklist**

- [x] **Review Requirements**
  - *List the key D/S requirements reviewed:* Cluster admins can limit the access to virtualization components

- [x] **Understand Value and Customer Use Cases**
  - *Describe the feature's value to customers:* Organizations running multi-tenant clusters
    need to enforce access policies that prevent unauthorized users from consuming
    virtualization resources. Without this feature, any project administrator automatically
    gains full virtualization access, which violates tenant isolation requirements.
  - *List the customer use cases identified:*
    - As a cluster administrator managing a multi-tenant cluster, I want to prevent tenants
      from accessing virtualization workloads they are not eligible to use so that different
      namespaces can enforce different workload entitlements

- [x] **Testability**
  - *Note any requirements that are unclear or untestable:* All requirements are testable
    through standard API and RBAC validation.

- [x] **Acceptance Criteria**
  - *List the acceptance criteria:*
    - When opt-out is enabled, a project admin in a namespace is forbidden from attempting virtualization actions
    - When opt-out is enabled, a cluster administrator can grant a user an explicit
      role binding (admin, edit, or view) so that user can create, modify, or view
      virtual machines and related resources in that namespace
    - Configuration changes take effect without cluster restart
  - *Note any gaps or missing criteria:* None. Defined in CNV-63822 epic.

- [x] **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**
  - *List applicable NFRs and their targets:*
    - Security: RBAC hardening — users blocked without explicit grant
    - Backward Compatibility: default unchanged
    - UI: console changes tracked under CNV-80935
    - Docs: user-facing documentation required
  - *Note any NFRs not covered and why:*
    - Performance: N/A — negligible RBAC overhead
    - Monitoring: N/A — no new metrics/alerts, uses standard Kubernetes RBAC
    - Scalability: N/A — scales with Kubernetes natively
    - Observability: N/A — standard audit logging covers RBAC decisions

#### **2. Known Limitations**

The limitations are documented to ensure alignment between development, QA, and product teams.
The following are confirmed product constraints accepted before testing begins.

None — reviewed and confirmed with [Name/Date — TBD] that no feature limitations apply for
this release.

#### **3. Technology and Design Review**

- [x] **Developer Handoff/QE Kickoff**
  - *Key takeaways and concerns:* Testing strategy agreed: tier 1 tests validate configuration behavior, with
    reconciliation coverage needed once downstream integration lands. Concern raised that
    tier 1 tests are not part of gating jobs — further review needed on test prioritization
    for tier 2.

- [x] **Technology Challenges**
  - *List identified challenges:* N/A
  - *Impact on testing approach:* N/A

- [x] **API Extensions**
  - *List new or modified APIs:* New cluster-level configuration field to control role
    aggregation behavior (default: enabled, opt-out: manual).
  - *Testing impact:* Tests must validate config changes and downstream RBAC effects.

- [x] **Test Environment Needs**
  - *See environment requirements in Section II.3 and testing tools in Section II.3.1*

- [x] **Topology Considerations**
  - *Describe topology requirements:* Feature is cluster-scoped and topology-independent.
  - *Impact on test design:* Works on all topologies (standard, SNO, compact).

### **II. Software Test Plan (STP)**

This STP serves as the **overall roadmap for testing**, detailing the scope, approach, resources,
and schedule.

#### **1. Scope of Testing**

**Testing Goals**

- **[P0]** Verify a cluster administrator can enable role aggregation opt-out through the cluster configuration and the setting persists
- **[P0]** Verify that when opt-out is enabled, an unprivileged user with a project admin role cannot perform virtualization admin actions (receives Forbidden error)
- **[P0]** Verify that when opt-out is enabled, an unprivileged user with an edit role cannot perform virtualization edit actions (receives Forbidden error)
- **[P0]** Verify that when opt-out is enabled, an unprivileged user with a view role cannot perform virtualization view actions (receives Forbidden error)
- **[P0]** Verify that a cluster administrator can explicitly grant virtualization admin, edit, and view permissions to a user when opt-out is enabled, and the user can perform the corresponding actions
- **[P0]** Verify that disabling opt-out after it was enabled restores automatic access for users who were previously blocked

**Regression Goals**

- **[P0]** Verify default behavior is preserved across OpenShift Virtualization z-stream upgrades — sig-iuo upgrade regression suites run on the feature cluster
- **[P0]** Verify existing RBAC and migration functionality is not broken by the new feature — sig-iuo regression suites (including RBAC hardening and migration rights tests) run on the feature cluster

**Out of Scope (Testing Scope Exclusions)**

The following items are explicitly Out of Scope for this test cycle and represent intentional
exclusions. No verification activities will be performed for these items, and any related issues
found will not be classified as defects for this release.

- **Testing OpenShift RBAC infrastructure itself**
  - *Rationale:* Core RBAC evaluation is the responsibility of the OCP platform team; no duplication of their test effort
  - *PM/Lead Agreement:* [Name/Date — TBD]

- **Testing all individual permission rules within virtualization roles**
  - *Rationale:* Individual role rules are not affected by this feature; this feature controls whether roles are aggregated, not the content of the roles themselves
  - *PM/Lead Agreement:* [Name/Date — TBD]

- **External IdP compatibility (LDAP, Active Directory)**
  - *Rationale:* RBAC logic is IdP-agnostic; HTPasswd testing validates the core permission logic
  - *PM/Lead Agreement:* [Name/Date — TBD]

- **Multi-tenant cluster scale testing (100+ users)**
  - *Rationale:* RBAC evaluation overhead is negligible; functional correctness at smaller scale is sufficient
  - *PM/Lead Agreement:* [Name/Date — TBD]

**Test Limitations**

None — reviewed and confirmed that no test limitations apply for this release.
*Sign-off:* [Name/Date — TBD]

#### **2. Test Strategy**

**Functional**

- [x] **Functional Testing** — Validates that the feature works according to specified requirements and user stories
  - *Details:* Core focus: verify opt-out configuration, RBAC enforcement, explicit grants, and default behavior preservation.

- [x] **Automation Testing** — Confirms test automation plan is in place for CI and regression coverage (all tests are expected to be automated)
  - *Details:* All tier 1 and tier 2 tests automated; tier 1 validates configuration, tier 2 validates end-to-end user workflows.

- [x] **Regression Testing** — Verifies that new changes do not break existing functionality
  - *Details:* Existing RBAC/migration tests provide regression coverage; standard sig-iuo suites run on feature cluster. Migrate role aggregation is already covered by existing tier 2 regression tests ([test_migration_rights.py](https://github.com/RedHatQE/openshift-virtualization-tests/blob/main/tests/virt/cluster/migration_and_maintenance/rbac_hardening/test_migration_rights.py)).

**Non-Functional**

- [ ] **Performance Testing** — Validates feature performance meets requirements (latency, throughput, resource usage)
  - *Details:* N/A — feature adds no performance-sensitive operations; RBAC evaluation overhead is negligible.

- [ ] **Scale Testing** — Validates feature behavior under increased load and at production-like scale (e.g., large number of VMs, nodes, or concurrent operations)
  - *Details:* N/A — Kubernetes RBAC scales natively; feature does not introduce new scalability concerns.

- [x] **Security Testing** — Verifies security requirements, RBAC, authentication, authorization, and vulnerability scanning
  - *Details:* Feature is a security enhancement; tests verify users are correctly blocked and explicit grants work for all 3 role levels.

- [x] **Usability Testing** — Validates user experience and accessibility requirements
  - *Details:* UI changes tracked under [CNV-80935](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-80935); UI team (sig-ui) owns console testing; QE validates config workflow feedback.

- [ ] **Monitoring** — Does the feature require metrics and/or alerts?
  - *Details:* No new metrics or alerts required; feature uses standard Kubernetes RBAC.

**Integration & Compatibility**

- [x] **Compatibility Testing** — Ensures feature works across supported platforms, versions, and configurations
  - *Details:* Default behavior unchanged; backward compatibility with previous API versions maintained.

- [x] **Upgrade Testing** — Validates upgrade paths from previous versions, data migration, and configuration preservation
  - *Details:* Verify default behavior preserved across z-stream upgrades; verify opt-out config persists after upgrade.

- [ ] **Dependencies** — Blocked by deliverables from other components/products. Identify what we need from other teams before we can test.
  - *Details:* No blocking dependencies; upstream and downstream implementations are complete.

- [x] **Cross Integrations** — Does the feature affect other features or require testing by other teams? Identify the impact we cause.
  - *Details:* UI team (sig-ui) needs to implement and test console changes ([CNV-80935](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-80935)).

**Infrastructure**

- [ ] **Cloud Testing** — Does the feature require multi-cloud platform testing? Consider cloud-specific features.
  - *Details:* N/A — feature is RBAC-based and platform-independent; no cloud-specific behavior.

#### **3. Test Environment**

- **Cluster Topology:** Standard or SNO — feature works on all topologies; multi-node preferred

- **OCP & OpenShift Virtualization Version(s):** OCP 4.22 with OpenShift Virtualization 4.22

- **CPU Virtualization:** N/A — not relevant for RBAC testing

- **Compute Resources:** Minimum per worker node: 4 vCPUs, 16GB RAM

- **Special Hardware:** N/A — no special hardware required

- **Storage:** Any RWX storage class (e.g., ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd-virtualization)

- **Network:** OVN-Kubernetes, IPv4 — no special network requirements

- **Required Operators:** OpenShift Virtualization (standard installation)

- **Platform:** Any supported platform (bare metal, AWS, Azure, GCP — no platform-specific behavior)

- **Special Configurations:** HTPasswd identity provider — REQUIRED: Must have HTPasswd IdP with unprivileged user

#### **3.1. Testing Tools & Frameworks**

- **Test Framework:** Standard

- **CI/CD:** N/A

- **Other Tools:** N/A

#### **4. Entry Criteria**

The following conditions must be met before testing can begin:

- [ ] Requirements and design documents are **approved and merged**
- [ ] Test environment can be **set up and configured** (see Section II.3 - Test Environment)
- [x] KubeVirt PR #16350 **merged** (upstream implementation)
- [x] HCO downstream implementation **complete** (field integrated into HCO CR)
- [x] Developer Handoff/QE Kickoff meeting completed

#### **5. Risks**

**Timeline/Schedule**

- **Risk:** N/A — feature implementation is complete (upstream and downstream).
  - **Mitigation:** N/A
  - *Estimated impact on schedule:* None
  - *Sign-off:* [Name/Date — TBD]

**Test Coverage**

- **Risk:** Cannot exhaustively test all RBAC role combinations and permission permutations.
  - **Mitigation:** Focus on the 3 critical role levels (admin, edit, view) covering acceptance criteria; individual permission rules within roles are unaffected by this feature.
  - *Areas with reduced coverage:* Individual permission rules within each virtualization role; only role-level access is validated.
  - *Sign-off:* [Name/Date — TBD]

**Test Environment**

- **Risk:** N/A — standard OCP cluster with HTPasswd IdP is sufficient; no special hardware required.
  - **Mitigation:** N/A
  - *Missing resources or infrastructure:* None
  - *Sign-off:* [Name/Date — TBD]

**Untestable Aspects**

- **Risk:** Cannot test with production identity providers (LDAP, Active Directory, OAuth) in the lab.
  - **Mitigation:** RBAC logic is IdP-agnostic; HTPasswd validation covers the enforcement path regardless of IdP.
  - *Alternative validation approach:* Functional validation with HTPasswd covers the RBAC enforcement path regardless of IdP.
  - *Sign-off:* [Name/Date — TBD]

**Resource Constraints**

- **Risk:** N/A — no staffing or capacity constraints; feature testing scope is manageable with assigned QE resources.
  - **Mitigation:** N/A
  - *Current capacity gaps:* None
  - *Sign-off:* [Name/Date — TBD]

**Dependencies**

- **Risk:** UI changes ([CNV-80935](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-80935)) are pending; console configuration interface may not be ready for testing.
  - **Mitigation:** Track progress with UI team (sig-ui); API-level testing can proceed independently of UI.
  - *Dependent teams or components:* sig-ui — console configuration interface for opt-out
  - *Sign-off:* [Name/Date — TBD]

**Other**

- **Risk:** N/A — no additional risks identified.
  - **Mitigation:** N/A
  - *Sign-off:* [Name/Date — TBD]
