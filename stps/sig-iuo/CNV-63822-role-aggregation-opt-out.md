### **Feature Overview**

Role Aggregation Opt-Out gives cluster administrators the ability to control which users can
access OpenShift Virtualization resources on a per-namespace basis. By default, OpenShift
Virtualization grants all project administrators, editors, and viewers automatic access to
virtualization resources through role aggregation. When opt-out is enabled, this automatic
access is removed, and administrators must explicitly grant virtualization permissions to
individual users through role bindings. This feature supports multi-tenant environments where
not all users should have access to virtualization workloads, and enables fine-grained control
over resource usage across namespaces.

|:---------------------------------------|:-----|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------|
| **Review Requirements**                | [x]  | As a cluster-admin I want to decide which users will have access to the virtualization in the cluster. Not all project-admins should have this access but only the eligible ones | Per CNV-50792 feature request |
| **Understand Value**                   | [x]  | A cluster-admin wants to control which users has access to view/create/edit openshift virtualization resources on a given namespace                                              | Per CNV-50792 feature request |
| **Customer Use Cases**                 | [x]  | * multi-tenant clusters                                                                                                                                                          |different namespaces are used to allow different workloads and prevent unallowed usage of workload that the tenant is not eligible to us|
|                                        |      | * Resources usage control                                                                                                                                                        |cluster admin wants to get a request to allow a specific user to create VMs and Storage|
| **Testability**                        | [x]  | All requirements are testable through standard API and RBAC validation                                                                                                           | Ready to implement tests  |
| **Acceptance Criteria**                | [x]  | (1) When opt-out is enabled, a project admin in a namespace receives Forbidden when attempting virtualization actions (2) When opt-out is enabled, explicit role bindings for admin/edit/view grant the corresponding virtualization access (3) When opt-out is disabled (default), all users with project roles retain automatic access — no change from previous releases (4) Configuration changes persist without cluster restart | Defined in CNV-63822 epic |
| **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)** | [x]  | Security: RBAC hardening — users blocked without explicit grant. Backward Compatibility: default unchanged. UI: console changes tracked under CNV-80935. Docs: user-facing documentation required. Performance: N/A — negligible RBAC overhead. Monitoring: N/A — no new metrics/alerts, uses standard Kubernetes RBAC. Scalability: N/A — scales with Kubernetes natively. Observability: N/A — standard audit logging covers RBAC decisions | Upgrade and docs coverage required                    |

### **II. Software Test Plan (STP)**

#### **1. Scope of Testing**

**Testing Goals**

- **[P0]** Verify a cluster administrator can enable role aggregation opt-out through the cluster configuration and the setting persists
- **[P0]** Verify that when opt-out is enabled, an unprivileged user with a project admin role cannot perform virtualization admin actions (receives Forbidden error)
- **[P0]** Verify that when opt-out is enabled, an unprivileged user with an edit role cannot perform virtualization edit actions (receives Forbidden error)
- **[P0]** Verify that when opt-out is enabled, an unprivileged user with a view role cannot perform virtualization view actions (receives Forbidden error)
- **[P0]** Verify that a cluster administrator can explicitly grant virtualization admin, edit, and view permissions to a user when opt-out is enabled, and the user can perform the corresponding actions
- **[P0]** Verify a cluster administrator can disable role aggregation opt-out and default automatic access is restored
- **[P0]** Verify default behavior (role aggregation enabled) remains unchanged when the feature is not configured
- **[P0]** Verify default behavior is preserved across OpenShift Virtualization z-stream upgrades
- **[P1]** Verify that toggling opt-out off after it was enabled restores automatic access for users who previously lost it
- **[P1]** Verify that removing an explicit role binding while opt-out is enabled immediately revokes the user's virtualization access

**Out of Scope:**

|:----------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------|
| Testing OpenShift RBAC infrastructure itself              | Core RBAC evaluation is the responsibility of the OCP platform team; no duplication of their test effort | [Name/Date — TBD]  |
| Testing all individual permission rules within virtualization roles | Individual role rules are not affected by this feature; this feature controls whether roles are aggregated, not the content of the roles themselves | [Name/Date — TBD]  |
| External IdP compatibility (LDAP, Active Directory)       | RBAC logic is IdP-agnostic; HTPasswd testing validates the core permission logic | [Name/Date — TBD]  |
| Multi-tenant cluster scale testing (100+ users)           | RBAC evaluation overhead is negligible; functional correctness at smaller scale is sufficient | [Name/Date — TBD]  |

**Note:** Migrate role aggregation testing is already covered by existing tier 2 regression tests
([test_migration_rights.py](https://github.com/RedHatQE/openshift-virtualization-tests/blob/main/tests/virt/cluster/migration_and_maintenance/rbac_hardening/test_migration_rights.py))
and is therefore documented as existing coverage, not out of scope.

**Test Limitations**

None — reviewed and confirmed that no test limitations apply for this release.

| Upgrade Testing    | Validates upgrade paths from previous versions, data migration, and configuration preservation                     | Y                       | Verify default behavior preserved across z-stream upgrades; verify opt-out config persists after upgrade |
| Dependencies       | Dependent on deliverables from other components/products? Identify what is tested by which team                    | N                       | No blocking dependencies; upstream and downstream implementations are complete |
| Cross Integrations | Does the feature affect other features/require testing by other components? Identify what is tested by which team  | Y                       | UI team (sig-ui) needs to implement and test console changes ([CNV-80935](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-80935)) |
| Cloud Testing      | Does the feature require multi-cloud platform testing? Consider cloud-specific features                            | N                       | Feature is RBAC-based and platform-independent; no cloud-specific behavior |
